Build a Project Idea Board
Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

1.  You should define an object constant named projectStatus with the three keys: PENDING, SUCCESS, and FAILURE. Each status should be assigned an object with a description key with the value Pending Execution, Executed Successfully, and Execution Failed, respectively.
2.  You should define a class named ProjectIdea with a constructor that takes title and description as parameters. Initialize the title and description properties with the provided parameters. The class should also have a property named status that is set to the value projectStatus.PENDING by default.
3.  You should define a method named updateProjectStatus inside the ProjectIdea class. This method should accept a newStatus parameter and update the status property to the given value.
4.  You should define a ProjectIdeaBoard class with a constructor that accepts a title and initializes an empty array named ideas to hold instances of the ProjectIdea class.
5.  You should define a method named pin inside the ProjectIdeaBoard class that accepts an instance of the ProjectIdea class and pushes the given instance to the ideas array.
6.  You should define a method named unpin inside the ProjectIdeaBoard class. This method should accept an instance of the ProjectIdea class and removes it from the ideas array.
7.  You should define a method named count that returns the number of project ideas in the given ProjectIdeaBoard array.
8.  You should define a method named formatToString that returns the name of the projects ideas, their description and status in the format:
Example Code
